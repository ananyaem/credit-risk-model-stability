# Credit Risk Model Stability

A machine learning project for predicting credit risk with a focus on model stability over time. This project implements various ML models (LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost) to assess loan default probability while ensuring consistent performance across different time periods.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Python modules for data processing, feature engineering, and modeling
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploration and submission
- `app/` - Streamlit application for model visualization and interaction
